# python-exercises
Gist is not my favorite option, and I need to check this small text from time to time.

The main idea is to have 2 folders:

- working_samples
    - Samples that you can use on the fly and will give an output or what is expected
- exercises
    - This is about pages and books we are doing their exersices
